Jupyter notebook file contains Linear Regression analysis performed on advertising dataset.

The basic idea behind the F-test is that it is a relative comparison between the model that you've built and the model without any of the coefficients except for 
Î²0
 . If the value of the F-statistic is high, it would mean that the Prob(F) would be low and hence, you can conclude that the model is significant. On the other hand, if the value of F-statistic is low, it might lead to the value of Prob(F) being higher than the significance level (taken 0.05, usually) which in turn would conclude that the overall model fit is insignificant and the intercept-only model can provide a better fit.
